# Final Project - CRUD Application

For the final project you will implement a fully featured web application with the features listed below. Completing these features will get you a satisfactory grade (B or B+), if you want an excellent grade you will need to go above and beyond and add additional features to your application.

These projects will need to be accomplished in groups of three or four people. Please see the Professor for permission to form groups other than three or four. We will be using the Groups features of Canvas to form groups and manage the submission and gradings. Please see the Forming Groups page for details on how to create your groups. Students who have not been able to form groups will be assigned groups.

## Features

- Backend:

  - MVC structure using Node, Express, and a templating system like EJS or Pug (if doing server side rendering)
  - Persistent data storage ([MongoDB with Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), but you may use SQL if you want to use [Glitch's SQLite support](https://glitch.com/~hello-sqlite))
  - Log-in and sign-up functions (using OAuth or secure password or both)
  - Admin capabilities for performing advanced functions in the application that are only available to specific admin users
  - Session management capabilities
  - RESTful Web service API with CRUD operations and managing authentication with an API key
  - You should properly validate and handle errors. E.g. I should only be able to view my profile

- Frontend:
  - Customized interface for different users and different types of users (Admin view vs Regular User view)
  - Web forms for Signup, Login, and to allow users to edit their profile with form validation
  - Use advanced HTML 5 APIs on the client side (location aware, storage, etc.)
  - Enhanced interactions with JavaScript (with vanilla JavaScript, Jquery, or other framework)
  - Polished responsive, and consistent design using CSS (either with vanilla CSS or a framework like Bootstrap)
  - Responsive design that supports 2 different viewports/breakpoints
  - Populate the application with data and content so we don’t see an empty web application

## Deployment

All teams must use Glitch for their final project. You may use another service, like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), for persistent storage, but the main application must be deployed on Glitch. Glitch provides [some very nice collaboration features that allow multiple users to edit code in real-time](https://glitch.com/help/how-do-i-invite-collaborators-to-edit-my-project/) (just like Google Docs). If you don't like the Glitch editor, you should check out the [Visual Studio Code plugin for Glitch](https://medium.com/glitch/announcing-glitch-for-visual-studio-code-87497b5159c0), it lets you use a nicer editor and still allows for the real-time collaboration features. It is pretty cool.

# Report

Your team will be responsible for writing up a Project Report that describes consist of the following sections:

- **Introduction** - Introduce the team and provide a high level description of the project. Be sure to include full names and Pitt IDs.
- **Objective** - Describe with more specific details what your objectives and goals are for the project. What problems did you want to solve or what did you want to learn in developing this application? What features, beyond the ones listed in the assignment requirements, did you implement?
- **Team member’s contributions** - Describe in detail what each member of the team did on the project.
- **Technical Architecture** - What are the libraries, frameworks, and other technologies you used and how did you put them together. Use the MVC conceptual model to provide a guide (i.e. what are the models/views/controllers and what do they do).
- **Challenges** - Discuss any challenges you faced in trying to develop this app. Were there libraries or technologies you wanted to use but we’re frustrating? Where there features you couldn’t get working?
- **Future Work** - What features would you like to add to your application? If you had more time what technologies would you like to learn?
- **Conclusion** - Reflect upon the web technologies and standards you learned in this course, did you learn what you wanted? What technologies or standards do you think would be useful in future iterations of this course?
- **Documentation** - List any resources that you used in creating this project.
- Include any specific instructions for testing the functionality of your application.

Write your report in markdown and **save it as Report.md** in the root of your project code directory.

# Presentations

The final class session, April 23rd, has been set aside for students to present their projects. This class session will happen virtually using Zoom. Each group Groups will be selected at random so you will need to be present for the entire class session. Each group will have around 10 mins to present. The presentations should contain the following:

- An introduction to what kind of application you created
- Describe your technology stack
- A demonstration of all the features and functionality of your application
- A discussion of the technologies you used
- A discussion of the challenges you encountered developing your application
- List the role/contribution of each person on the team (e.g. Front-end, Back-end or some combination)

# Submission

- Only one student in your group needs to submit the final project on Canvas. As long as you have created a Canvas group the grades and comments will be distributed to all group members. That said, be sure to include the names and Pitt IDs of your teammates in your Report.md file in the project.
- Submit the link to your Glitch Project page (the one with the ~), **make sure to not set the Glitch project to private!**
- Include your Team Name in the Glitch project name (e.g. homework-helper)
- **Your Final Projects are due on the last day of class at 11:59pm on Thursday, April 23rd.**
